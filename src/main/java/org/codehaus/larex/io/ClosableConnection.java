/**
 * <p>Partial implementation of {@link Connection} that provides close functionalities.</p>
 * <p>Closing a connection can be done in two ways: hard closing the connection, or soft
 * closing the connection.</p>
 * <p>When a connection is {@link #close() hard closed}, the socket associated with the connection
 * is closed (via {@link SocketChannel#close()}).</p>
 * <p>When a connection is {@link #softClose(long) soft closed}, only its output is shut down (via
 * {@link Socket#shutdownOutput()}), but not its input; the remote end of the connection
 * detects this ({@link #remoteCloseEvent()} is invoked, or equivalently a raw socket would read -1),
 * and may optionally decide to write the last data before hard closing the connection.<br />
 * The connection reads the last data sent by the remote end, then detects that the remote end
 * was closed and can now hard close the connection.<br />
 * Note however that the remote end cannot know if the connection was soft closed or hard closed,
 * so it must be prepared to failures when writing the last data.</p>
