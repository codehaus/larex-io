/**
 * <p>Implementation of {@link ByteBuffers} that caches and reuses buffers.</p>
 * <p>Buffers will be created in capacity steps controlled by a factor, to avoid
 * that a new buffer is created for each different capacity.<br />
 * Therefore, if the factor is 1024 (the default) and a request for size 2500 arrives,
 * then a buffer of capacity 3072 (1024 * 3) is created and returned.
 * If, later on, a request for size 3000 arrives, the same buffer is returned.</p>
